# Stripper

This application will be a CLI tool that uses Cobra, Viper, and the charm libraies.

## Purpose
The web scraper is designed to systematically crawl and archive web content from a specified domain. It leverages the Reader API to retrieve content in a structured format, making it ideal for archiving documentation, articles, and other textual resources.

## Key Features

### Automated Crawling
- Processes URLs in batches
- Handles link extraction and content retrieval
- Implements delays between requests to respect server load
- Tracks progress and maintains statistics

### Error Handling
- Implements robust retry logic with exponential backoff
- Detects and logs recurring error patterns
- Provides detailed error tracking and reporting
- Handles various error types differently (e.g., connection errors, timeouts, HTTP errors)

### Data Management
- Stores retrieved content locally in markdown format
- Maintains a database for tracking URLs and their status
- Associates content with metadata for easy retrieval
- Provides comprehensive statistics and reporting

### Extensibility
- Designed with modularity in mind
- Easy to adapt to different content sources
- Supports various output formats and storage mechanisms
- Flexible configuration options

## Approach

### Crawling Strategy
1. **Initialization**: Configures initial settings and connects to necessary components.
2. **Content Retrieval**: Uses the Jina Reader API to fetch content from specified URLs.
3. **Link Extraction**: Parses HTML to find and normalize new URLs for crawling.
4. **Content Storage**: Saves content locally and updates the database.
5. **Progress Tracking**: Maintains statistics and provides regular progress updates.

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Retry Mechanism**: Implements exponential backoff for failed requests.
- **Error Tracking**: Monitors errors per URL and detects patterns.
- **Specific Handling**: Applies different strategies for various error types.
- **Reporting**: Provides detailed error statistics and distribution.

### Data Management Strategy
- **Database**: Tracks URLs, their status, and associated content.
- **Local Storage**: Saves content in markdown format for easy access.
- **Metadata**: Associates content with relevant information for context.
- **Statistics**: Offers insights into crawl progress and efficiency.

## Benefits
- **Comprehensive Archiving**: Systematically archives web content for future reference.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Minimizes data loss due to transient failures.
- **Efficient Crawling**: Optimizes resource usage while respecting server limits.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Adapts to different use cases and requirements.

## Use Cases
