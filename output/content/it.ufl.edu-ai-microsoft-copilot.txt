Security, Privacy, Data Classification Usage Guidelines

When used with your GatorLink login Microsoft provides additional protection of your data above and beyond the basic publicly available Microsoft Copilot service. At this time, UF does not permit the usage of restricted or sensitive data with UF GPT powered by Microsoft Copilot, please see the UF Data Guide for more information. Conversation history is not retained post each session, and user interactions do not contribute to training the large language model. Further work is underway to assess the service for use with additional data classifications. Check back here for further updates.

 

 

Using Microsoft Copilot

AI-powered tool designed to assist users in a variety of tasks. Whether you are in pursuit of specific information, require assistance with a particular task, or simply wish to engage in a conversation, Microsoft Copilot is available through your browsers and your phone.

Microsoft Copilot uses a version of the Generative Pretrained Transformer model, specifically GPT-4. This model is more complex and capable of handling different kinds of inputs, including images, compared to its predecessor, GPT-3.5.
