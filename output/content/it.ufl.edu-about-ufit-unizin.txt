Solving Strategic Challenges in Higher Education

The University of Florida is a founding member institution of the Unizin consortium. Launched in 2014, Unizin’s mandate is to leverage resources on higher education IT priorities. One example of this shared vision manifested as the Unizin Data Platform, a first of its kind solution to integrating learner-relevant data from multiple sources propelling significant advancements in education research and student success. We also leverage their vendor partnerships to bring the latest in educational technology products to our campus at the most affordable rates available in the market.

Interested in collaborating on research projects with member institutions, or have your own line of inquiry? Find information on the Unizin Data Platform (UDP) and more.
