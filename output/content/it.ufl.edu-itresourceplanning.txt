The Business Relations Managers Group

The Business Relationship Managers (BRM) serve as advocates for enterprise IT to advance the mission of the university. BRMs liaise with core administrative offices to identify opportunities that will improve UF’s information technology environment. BRMs also serve as a “front door” for campus, connecting core office staff with the right technical support, solutions, and guidance.

If you are looking for business relations support for an area that is not listed below, please reach out via our team email: UFIT-BRM@ad.ufl.edu.

The Project Management Office

The UFIT Project Management Office (PMO) helps the university implement strategic solutions through the successful planning and monitoring of portfolios, programs, and projects. The UFIT PMO standardizes project-related governance processes and utilizes tools and methodologies that support collaboration across systems, facilitates communication with stakeholders, and maximizes productivity.

Define the scope and deliverables 
Identify the work and resources required to achieve project deliverables 
Create and maintain work plans from inception to close, identifying the milestones and deliverables 
Manage project risks and issues including mitigation planning and escalation where appropriate
Perform integrated change management
